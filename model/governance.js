		'• IT resources are used responsibly',
		'• IT risks are managed appropriately',
		'Performance measurement is essential for IT governance. It is supported by COBIT and includes setting and monitoring measurable objectives of what the IT processes need to deliver (process outcome) and how to deliver it (process capability and performance). Many surveys have identified that the lack of transparency of IT’s cost, value and risks is one of the most important drivers for IT governance. While the other focus areas contribute, transparency is primarily achieved through performance measurement.'
